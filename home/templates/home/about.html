    It started with a carton of milk.
    </p>

  <p class="navy-text fs-5 mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px;">
    A carton of milk in the back of a fridge — still good, but just about to expire. That small moment made us realize how much food on campus ends up wasted even though it’s perfectly fine. At the same time, many students are stretching budgets or skipping meals.
  </p>

  <!-- Our Idea -->
  <h2 class="text-center eggshell-text mt-5 mb-3">Our Idea</h2>
  <p class="navy-text fs-5 mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px;">
    We built this platform to make it easy for students to share food that might otherwise go to waste. Maybe it’s groceries you won’t finish before a break, leftovers from a club meeting, or snacks you bought and never opened — whatever it is, someone else on campus could use it.
  </p>

    <ul class="navy-text fs-5 mx-auto" 
    style="max-width: 700px; list-style-position: inside; text-align: center; padding-left: 0;">
    <li>Save good food from being thrown away.</li>
    <li>Help students get access to free meals.</li>
    <li>Build a stronger sense of community.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="navy-text fs-5 mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px;">
    And let’s be real — who doesn’t love free food?
  </p>

<!-- Why It Matters -->
<h2 class="text-center eggshell-text mt-5 mb-4">Why It Matters</h2>
<p class="navy-text fs-5 mx-auto text-center" style="max-width: 800px;">
  Food waste isn’t just a small issue — it’s a massive global problem that we can actually do something about right here on campus. By sharing food before it’s thrown out, we’re cutting down waste, saving money, and helping students who might otherwise go without a meal.

  By creating a space to share what we don’t need, we can turn those numbers around — one meal, one post, and one small choice at a time.

  <!-- Looking Ahead -->
  <h2 class="text-center eggshell-text mt-5 mb-3">Looking Ahead</h2>
  <p class="navy-text fs-5 mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px;">
    We’re starting here at Georgia Tech, but our vision goes beyond one campus.
  </p>
  <p class="navy-text fs-5 mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px;">
    We hope to grow into nearby neighborhoods, local businesses, and other universities across Georgia — building a bigger network of people working toward the same simple goal: making sure good food feeds people, not landfills.
